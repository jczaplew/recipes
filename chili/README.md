# Badger chili
A riff on the popular [Boilermaker Tailgate Chili](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/78299/boilermaker-tailgate-chili/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringContentType=search%20results&clickId=cardslot%202), this version ramps up the spicy and down the salt. No bacon bits, canned sauces, or other bullshit.

## Ingredients
+ Ground sirloin (2lbs)
+ Hot Italian sausage (1lb)
+ Low sodium diced tomatoes (62oz)
+ Tomato paste (6oz)
+ Red kidney beans (2 cans)
+ Cannellini beans (2 cans)
+ Celery (5 stalks)
+ Onion (1 large)
+ Garlic (5 cloves)
+ Jalape単os (2)
+ Dried chipotle peppers (3)
+ Dried arbole chilies (2)
+ A chewy porter (12oz)
+ Chili powder (1/4 cup)
+ Dried oregano (1 Tbsp)
+ Cumin (1/2 Tbsp)
+ Dried basil (1/2 Tbsp)
+ Smoked paprika (1/2 Tbsp)
+ Ground black pepper (1/2 Tbsp)

## Directions
Bring about 1.5 cups of water to a boil. Remove seeds from dried chilies, add to water, and set aside.

Set a large stockpot (6 quart works well) on medium heat and add ground sirloin and Italian sausage. Brown the meat. Remove it from the pot with a slotted spoon on to a paper towel-lined plate. Remove fat except for 1-2 Tbsp.

Dice the onion and chop the celery, garlic, and jalape単os. Return the pot to medium heat and add the onion, celery, garlic, and jalape単os.

Meanwhile, remove the formerly-dried chilies from the water (saving the water) and finely chop.

Cook the onion, celery, garlic, and jalape単os until the onion has softened somewhat and the garlic is fragrant. Add the chilies and cook for another minute. Add the diced tomatoes (including liquid) and tomato paste. Strain and rinse the kidney and cannellini beans and add to pot.

Combine chili powder, oregano, cumin, basil, paprika, and black pepper and add to pot. Stir to combine thoroughly. Add meat back to pot and stir in beer. If you need to thin it out, add water from the chilies until a desirable consistency is achieved.

Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer as long as you'd like, stirring occasionally. After a couple of hours have a taste and verify spice levels.

Serve with bread.
