# Sweet Potato Fries

## Ingredients
+ 2 medium yams (about 1.5lbs)
+ Olive oil
+ Paprika
+ Garlic powder
+ Kosher salt
+ Black pepper

## Directions
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place baking sheet in oven, and preheat oven to 450°F.

Cut yams into long match sticks length-wise. Each stick should be the length of the yam _x_ a little less than 1/4". Place into a large mixing bowl.

Add olive oil to mixing bowl (enough so that the yams are entirely covered and there is about a teaspoon sitting in the bottom of the bowl...just oversaturated) and toss to coat. Season with paprika, garlic powder, and liberally with kosher salt and black pepper. Toss to coat.

Once oven is preheated, remove baking sheet from the oven, add yams, and return to oven.

Set timer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, flip and move fries around and rotate the baking sheet 180°. 

Again, set time for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, do as before.

Depending on the thickness of your fries, more time may be needed, probably 5 – 10 more minutes. Cook until crispy (some smaller fries may appear burnt).

Let cool for 5 minutes, and serve with sriracha mayo.
