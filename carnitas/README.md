# Carnitas
I've long been a devotee of [this carnitas recipe](http://theyearinfood.com/2011/02/carnitas.html) from The Year in Food, but with a touch of inspiration from [NYTimes Cooking](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012463-tacos-de-carnitas) it becomes something else.

## Ingredients
+ Pork Butt (3-3.5lbs)
+ Onion (1 medium, or about 1-1.5 cups)
+ Garlic (8 cloves)
+ Orange (1)
+ Dried chipotle peppers (2)
+ Chili powder (3tsp)
+ Chipotle chili powder (3tsp)
+ Ground cumin (2tsp)
+ Salt
+ Pepper

## Directions
Whisk together chili powder, chipotle chili powder, cumin, 2 tsp of salt, and 1 tsp of ground black pepper.

If pork butt has slab of fat, trim it off, and then cut into about 2-3" chunks. Season liberally on all sides with seasoning mixture.

Dice onion, smash and peel garlic, and remove stems and about half the seeds from the chipotle peppers. Set aside.

Heat 2 tbsp of vegetable oil in a dutch oven on medium heat, and work in batches to brown all sides of the seasoned chunks of pork, removing to a plate when done.

Remove excess oil/fat from dutch oven, and return pork and juices to pot. Add onion, garlic, and peppers. Zest the orange into the pot, and then squeeze juice in. Add about 2 tsp of salt and a healthy dose of black pepper. Add enough water so that the pork is just barely covered and bring to a boil.

Simmer on medium-low for about 2 hours, skimming fat off the top and stirring occasionally. When liquid has reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount lightly shred the pork with two forks. Simmer, stirring fairly frequently and further breaking apart pork until the rest of the liquid is absorbed. Keep cooking until lightly crisped.

Serve on corn tortillas with guacamole, cotija, shredded red cabbage, and cilantro. Or whatever you like.
