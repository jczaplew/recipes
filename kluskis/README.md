# Kluskis
The recipe for kluskis is there is no recipe for kluskis. However, there are some loose guidelines and suggestions, so put on your apron and feel the potatoes.

If you are not familiar with kluskis, they are terrible-for-you-but-very-delicious fried Polish potato dumplings.


## Ingredients
+ Potatoes
+ Flour
+ Eggs
+ Onions
+ Bacon
+ Black pepper


## Directions
Wash and peel potatoes. 

What you'll need for your workspace:

+ A fine mesh strainer placed over a large mixing bowl
+ A box grater on a plate
+ One medium mixing bowl
+ A small bowl approximately the same size as the fine mesh strainer


Finely grate the potatoes, placing each grated potato in the fine mesh strainer over the bowl. Once the fine mesh strainer is approximately half full, use the small bowl to gently press the excess liquid out of the grated potatoes, and then place in the medium mixing bowl. Repeat.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

Add one or two eggs to the grated potatoes (use 2 if using more than 4lbs of potatoes) and combine with your hands. Gradually add flour approximately 1/3 of a cup at a time, working in with your hands, until a semi-sticky dumpling dough forms. If you are unsure whether or not you have added enough flour, form a small dumpling and drop it into the boiling water. If it falls apart, add more flour.

When the dough is ready, form dumplings by using the edge of a small spoon to scoop out an oblong dumpling. Gently roll through your hands and add to boiling water. Repeat.

Dumplings will float to the top of the pot when they are done. When they finish, remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and place in a colander. Rinse well with cold water and set aside in a bowl. 

Cut bacon into inch-wide chunks. Slice onion.

Working in batches if necessary, cook bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until it almost starts to crisp. Increase heat to medium high and add onion, cooking for about a minute. Add kluskis, season with a healthy amount of black pepper, and fry until golden.

Serve right away.
