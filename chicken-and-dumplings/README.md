# Chicken and dumplings
Adapted from a recipes from David Nimmer

## Ingredients
+ Chicken thighs (about 1lb)
+ Carrots (3)
+ Celery (3 stalks)
+ Onion (1 medium)
+ Spinach (1 bag)
+ Chicken stock (4 cups)
+ Thyme (dried, 1tsp)
+ Curry powder (1tsp)

## Directions
Remove skin from chicken thighs, season with salt and pepper, and place in a stock pot or dutch oven. Cover with water (about 4 cups), bring to a boil, then simmer until done. About 20 minutes.

While the chicken is cooking, cut the carrots into 1/2 inch rounds, slice the celery, and dice the onion. Set aside.

When the chicken is done, remove chicken from water with a slotted spoon, and reserve the water in a measuring cup. Once the chicken has cooled, shred and set aside.

Add 1tbsp of olive oil to the pot and add the mire poix, season with salt, pepper, thyme and curry powder, and cook until the the onion begins to soften. Add the water back to the pot, along with the rest of the chicken stock and the shredded chicken and bring to a simmer. 

In a large mixing bowl, combine 6 wisked eggs, 3 cups of flour, 1/4 cup sugar, and about two tablespoons of water. Stir to form a dough. Roll the dough out to about 1/8 inch thick sheet on a heavily floured surface. Cut the dough into strips about one and a half inches long and about 1/4 inch wide. Slowly drop the dumplings one-by-one into the pot.

Depending on how thick you like your soup, you may want to add up to 2 cups of water at this point. 

Wilt the spinach into the soup, add a healthy dose of black pepper, and serve.
